# SML
Collection of functions supporting arithmetic operations over large integers, written in SML.

Representing big integers as a string of integers (either "0" or a non-empty string that does not start with "0"), the program supports arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation.

Written for Hamilton College's Computer Science 220 (Principles of Programming Languages) course.
